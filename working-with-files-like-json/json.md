working with json files using python

in terms of pyhton, json is a dictionary, dictionary is a object in json

json load - reading content from json - gives us a dictionary
json dump - pushing/writing the content into json - here we can push the dictionary into a json file


How can we convert data into json or json to python

Summary, whenever we're reading the content from json we get the output as a dictionary with the help of json.load and
whenever we're dumping into a json file, our data must be a dictionary

python(dictionary)
json-equivalent(object)
